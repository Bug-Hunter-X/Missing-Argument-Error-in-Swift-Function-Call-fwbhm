# Missing Argument Error in Swift

This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: forgetting to provide all required arguments when calling a function. The example shows a simple `calculateArea` function and how omitting a required argument results in a compiler error.  The solution shows the correct way to call the function with all required arguments. 

This is a good example to illustrate the importance of carefully reviewing function signatures and providing all necessary inputs when calling functions.
